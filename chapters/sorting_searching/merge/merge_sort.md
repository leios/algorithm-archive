# Merge Sort

The general idea behind merge sort is simultaneously fascinating and stereotypical.
That is to say that this algorithm has gotten around and its offspring will definitely be seen stalking the halls of the Algorithm Archive.
It does not have the most applications, and it's not necessarily the fastest for most cases.
It knows its boundaries and sticks to them.
I can appreciate that in an algorithm.
If you are wondering, it's bounds are $$\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$$
