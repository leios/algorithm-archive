# Signal Processing

Signal processing is the art of taking a signal and processing it into something more easily understandable.
Not only is this a field of study unto itself, but it is also the heart of many computational and experimental research.

To be completely honest, this chapter is a bit of a stub.
There is a lot of content to cover in this area, but I need some discussion of signal processing to cover other methods in the Archive right now, so I will put the necessary information here and restructure the chapter later when I can look into everything in more depth.

For now, please excuse the fact that we have an entire section on signal processing, but only really cover two related topics: cross-correlations and convolutions.

## Cross-Correlations

## Convolutions

## Example Code

{% method %}
{% sample lang="jl" %}
[import, lang:"julia"](code/julia/IFS.jl)
{% endmethod %}

### Bibliography
